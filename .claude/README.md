# .claude/ - Project Coordination System

This directory contains files for coordinating multi-agent Claude Code workflows. Each file has a specific purpose in the orchestration system.

## Files Overview

### CLAUDE.md
**Purpose:** Guidelines and agent role definitions
**Who:** Read by all agents, defines the system
**Edit:** Update when changing agent responsibilities or core protocols

Core documentation explaining:
- The 5 agent personas (Manager, Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, Tester, Reviewer)
- How to read and write to coordination files
- Escalation procedures
- Protocol for inter-agent communication

### PLAN.md
**Purpose:** Task status board and source of truth
**Who:** Manager edits, all agents read
**Format:** Lightweight table with Task | Status | Assigned To | Priority

Manager uses this to:
- Break down user requests into atomic tasks
- Assign tasks to agents
- Track progress with status symbols
- Note task dependencies

Agents use this to:
- Find their [→] IN PROGRESS tasks
- Understand priorities and dependencies
- Report blockers as [⚠] BLOCKED

### WIKI.md
**Purpose:** Shared knowledge base and context
**Who:** All agents read/write
**Content:** Architecture, API specs, component specs, known issues, Q&A, session notes

Engineers use this to:
- Document APIs and component specs
- Ask questions for other agents
- Note blockers with timestamps
- Link related tasks and dependencies

Testers/Reviewers use this to:
- Document test failures (tagged "Test Failure:")
- Document code review findings (tagged "Code Review:")
- Link to specific file locations (file_path:line_number)

### TECH.md
**Purpose:** Project-specific technical standards
**Who:** All agents read, Manager/engineers update
**Content:** Language, frameworks, testing, code style, database, APIs, build process

All agents reference this to:
- Understand the project's tech stack
- Follow naming conventions
- Apply correct code style
- Use proper testing approach
- Build and deploy correctly

### PROGRESS.md
**Purpose:** Automatic work tracking across sessions
**Who:** Auto-generated by TodoWrite, do not edit manually
**Content:** Individual agent todos and completion status

## Workflow at a Glance

1. **Manager** reads user request → Updates PLAN.md with new tasks → Updates WIKI.md with context → Prompts next agent
2. **Frontend Engineer** reads PLAN.md → Finds [→] IN PROGRESS → Checks WIKI.md & TECH.md → Implements → Marks done in TodoWrite → Updates WIKI.md with questions
3. **Backend Engineer** reads PLAN.md → Finds [→] IN PROGRESS → Checks WIKI.md & TECH.md → Implements → Marks done in TodoWrite → Answers Frontend questions in WIKI.md
4. **Tester** reads PLAN.md → Finds test tasks → Checks WIKI.md for specs → Tests → Documents failures in WIKI.md → Marks done in TodoWrite
5. **Reviewer** reads PLAN.md → Finds review tasks → Checks WIKI.md for context → Reviews code → Documents findings in WIKI.md → Marks done in TodoWrite
6. **Documentation Agent** reads PLAN.md → Finds [✓] DONE tasks → Checks WIKI.md for specs → Writes root-level markdown docs → Marks done in TodoWrite
7. **Manager** monitors WIKI.md for blockers → Re-prioritizes → Updates PLAN.md → Continues cycle

## Tagged Communication

Agents use tags in WIKI.md to make asynchronous communication clear:

- **"Frontend Question:"** - Frontend Engineer asking Backend Engineer
- **"Frontend Needs:"** - Frontend Engineer's requirements for Backend Engineer
- **"Test Failure:"** - Tester documenting test failures for engineers
- **"Code Review:"** - Reviewer documenting findings for engineers
- **"Documentation Stale:"** - Documentation Agent flagging docs that diverge from code
- **"[⚠] BLOCKED"** - Task is blocked, details documented in WIKI.md

## Session Persistence

- PROGRESS.md is auto-managed by TodoWrite—tracks what each agent completed
- WIKI.md session notes at the bottom track context across sessions
- PLAN.md status updates show overall progress
- Agents pick up where they left off by reading their [→] IN PROGRESS tasks

## Key Principles

- **Lightweight coordination:** Only 3 active files (PLAN, WIKI, TECH)
- **Asynchronous:** Agents don't need to wait for each other; they communicate via files
- **Persistent:** Work tracking survives context switches via TodoWrite
- **Scalable:** WIKI.md grows without slowing down the system
- **Clear:** Each file has one purpose; no overlap
